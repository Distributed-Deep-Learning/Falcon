# Falcon
> All the practice of Falcon is for project Griffin.

A computation-parallel deep learning architecture.

# Quick Start of SSP Demo
The SSP demo is a part of Falcon, please find it in the directory `SSP_Demo` (all the demo files and related dataset are in this directory).

We hope to this can help researchers to start their first distrtibuted DL training in SSP scheme via [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

# Dataset
Two classical datasets are supported: MNIST and CIFAR-10.

* MNIST: This demo has already contained MNIST in the directory `data`, you can also download it from [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
* CIFAR-10: You can download it from [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
